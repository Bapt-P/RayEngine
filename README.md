# RayEngine

RayEngine is a raycasting game engine made with SFML.
It is in development (ft. Haiwa)

Languages: C++, CMake (and Makefile for the Linux branch)

Basically, it's a kind of 3D game engine in C ++ & SFML with the
raycasting technique. It is not a complicated technique to implement
place, but adding textures to the walls and fake 3D models is
something else.
I'm looking for one or two C ++ developers who are quite experienced with SFML
to help me realize this engine.

PS: Thanks to Haiwa who is the one with whom we had the idea of the project.
